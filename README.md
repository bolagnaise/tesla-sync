Includes intelligent operation mode switching - automatically saves your current Powerwall mode and switches to autonomous (TOU) mode during spikes, then restores your original mode when prices normalize
- 🌞 **Solar Curtailment** - Automatically prevents solar export during negative pricing periods (≤0c/kWh). When Amber feed-in prices go negative, the system sets Powerwall export to "never" to avoid paying to export, then restores to "battery_ok" when prices return to positive
- 🎯 **Custom TOU Schedules** - Create and manage custom time-of-use schedules for any electricity provider (not just Amber)
- 💾 **Saved TOU Profiles** - Backup, restore, and manage multiple tariff configurations
- 📈 **Demand Charge Tracking** - Monitor and track peak demand for electricity plans with capacity-based fees

### Technical Features
- 🔐 **Teslemetry Integration** - Secure Tesla API access via Teslemetry proxy service (no public domain required)
- 🔒 **Secure Credential Storage** - All API tokens encrypted at rest using Fernet encryption
- ⏱️ **Background Scheduler** - Automatic syncing every 5 minutes (aligned with Amber's forecast updates)
- 🐳 **Docker Ready** - Pre-built multi-architecture (amd64/arm64) images for easy deployment
- 🏠 **Home Assistant Integration** - Native HACS integration for seamless HA deployment
- 🌏 **Australia-Wide Compatibility** - Auto-detects timezone from Amber data, works in all Australian states (QLD, NSW, VIC, SA, TAS, WA, NT)
- 📊 **Intelligent Price Averaging** - Averages 5-minute Amber intervals into 30-minute Tesla periods for maximum accuracy
- 🎯 **Period Alignment** - Correctly aligns with Amber's forecast labels (e.g., "18:00 forecast" → Tesla PERIOD_17_30)
- 🔄 **Rolling 24-Hour Window** - Always provides Tesla with 9-24 hours lookahead for optimal battery management

## Key Features Explained

### AEMO Spike Detection
Automatically monitors AEMO NEM wholesale electricity prices for your region (NSW1, QLD1, VIC1, SA1, TAS1). When prices exceed your configured threshold (e.g., $300/MWh), the system:
- Saves your current tariff configuration
- **Saves your current Powerwall operation mode** (self_consumption, autonomous, or backup)
- **Automatically switches to autonomous (TOU) mode** (required for TOU tariffs to work)
- Uploads a spike tariff with very high sell rates to encourage battery export
- Tesla Powerwall responds by exporting to grid during the spike
- **Automatically restores your original operation mode** when spike ends
- Restores your normal tariff when prices return to normal

Perfect for maximizing revenue during extreme price events! Works seamlessly regardless of your normal Powerwall mode.

**Monitoring Frequency:** Checks AEMO prices every 1 minute for responsive spike detection (reduced from 5 minutes to minimize detection lag).

### Solar Curtailment
Prevents paying to export solar during negative pricing periods common with Amber Electric. The system monitors feed-in prices every minute and:

**During Negative Prices (≤0c/kWh):**
- Sets Powerwall export rule to "never" to prevent grid export
- Implements Tesla API bug workaround: if already set to "never", toggles to "pv_only" then back to "never" to force the setting to apply
- Protects you from financial penalties during negative price events

**During Positive Prices (>0c/kWh):**
- Restores export rule to "battery_ok" to allow both solar and battery export
- Enables normal revenue generation from grid export

**Configuration:**
- Enable/disable in Amber Settings (Flask web interface)
- Enable/disable during Home Assistant integration setup
- Default: Disabled (opt-in feature)

This feature is particularly useful with Amber's wholesale pricing to avoid paying to export your solar during oversupply periods.

### Custom TOU Schedules
Not using Amber Electric? No problem! Create custom time-of-use schedules for any Australian electricity provider:
- Define multiple seasonal periods (e.g., Summer, Winter)
- Set different rates for peak, shoulder, and off-peak periods
- Configure weekday/weekend variations
- Upload directly to Tesla Powerwall via Teslemetry

### Saved TOU Profiles
Backup and restore your tariff configurations:
- Save current Tesla tariff as named profile
- Restore previous configurations anytime
- Manage multiple tariff setups
- Pre-spike backup for AEMO spike detection

## How It Works

### Intelligent Price Conversion

Tesla Sync uses sophisticated algorithms to convert Amber Electric's dynamic pricing into Tesla-compatible TOU (Time-of-Use) tariffs:

#### 1. **Smart Period Mapping**
Amber Electric labels their forecasts using **END time** convention (e.g., "18:00 forecast" = 17:30-18:00 period), while Tesla uses **START time** labels (e.g., PERIOD_17_30 = 17:30-18:00). Tesla Sync automatically aligns these conventions so prices match exactly what you see in the Amber app.

#### 2. **5-Minute Averaging**
- **Recent/Current Prices:** Amber provides 5-minute actual intervals with high precision
- **Conversion:** Tesla Sync averages six 5-minute intervals into each 30-minute Tesla period
- **Result:** More accurate pricing that captures real market volatility
- **Example:** Period 20:00-20:30 averages prices from 20:05, 20:10, 20:15, 20:20, 20:25, 20:30

#### 3. **Rolling 24-Hour Window**
Tesla requires a static 24-hour tariff structure, but Tesla Sync makes it "roll" forward:
- **Future periods** (not yet reached today): Use today's forecast prices
- **Past periods** (already passed today): Use tomorrow's forecast prices
- **Benefit:** Tesla always has 9-24 hours of lookahead for every period, enabling optimal battery decisions

**Example at 2:15 PM:**
```
PERIOD_00_00 → Tomorrow's 00:00 forecast (+9h 45m lookahead)
PERIOD_14_00 → Today's 14:30 forecast    (+15m lookahead - current)
PERIOD_23_30 → Tomorrow's 00:00 forecast (+9h 45m lookahead)
```

#### 4. **Timezone Auto-Detection**
Works anywhere in Australia without configuration:
- **Brisbane (AEST UTC+10:00):** No DST
- **Sydney/Melbourne (AEDT UTC+11:00):** DST in summer
- **Adelaide (ACDT UTC+10:30):** Unique 30-minute offset + DST
- **Perth (AWST UTC+8:00):** No DST
- **Darwin (ACST UTC+9:30):** No DST

The system automatically extracts timezone information from Amber's API data, ensuring correct "past vs future" period detection for all locations.

#### 5. **Precision Matching**
Prices are rounded to **4 decimal places** with trailing zeros automatically removed:
- `0.2014191` → `0.2014` (4 decimals)
- `0.1990000` → `0.199` (3 decimals, trailing zeros dropped)

### Sync Frequency

**Every 5 minutes** - Perfectly aligned with Amber Electric's forecast update schedule for maximum freshness.

## Installation Options

Tesla Sync is available in two deployment options:

1. **[Home Assistant Integration](#home-assistant-integration)** - Native HA custom integration (Recommended for HA users)
2. **[Docker Application](#docker-deployment)** - Standalone web app with dashboard

---

## Home Assistant Integration

The easiest way to use Tesla Sync if you're already running Home Assistant.

### Features

- ✅ **Native HA Integration** - Seamless integration with your Home Assistant instance
- ✅ **HACS Installation** - Install and update via HACS (Home Assistant Community Store)
- ✅ **Automatic Discovery** - Auto-discovers Tesla energy sites from Teslemetry
- ✅ **Real-time Sensors** - Amber pricing and Tesla energy data as HA sensors
- ✅ **Automatic TOU Sync** - Background syncing every 5 minutes (just like Docker version)
- ✅ **Manual Services** - On-demand sync services for advanced automation
- ✅ **No External Services** - Runs entirely within Home Assistant

### Prerequisites

- Home Assistant installed and running
- HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) installed
- Teslemetry account with API token (https://teslemetry.com)
- Amber Electric account with API token (https://app.amber.com.au/developers)

### Installation Steps

1. **Install via HACS**
   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click the three dots in the top right
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add repository URL: `https://github.com/bolagnaise/tesla-sync`
   - Category: `Integration`
   - Click "Add"
   - Click "Download" on the Tesla Sync integration
   - Restart Home Assistant

2. **Add Integration**
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Click "+ Add Integration"
   - Search for "Tesla Sync"
   - Click to add

3. **Configure**
   - **Step 1: Amber Electric**
     - Enter your Amber API token
     - Get token from: https://app.amber.com.au/developers

   - **Step 2: Teslemetry**
     - Enter your Teslemetry API token
     - Get token from: https://teslemetry.com

   - **Step 3: Site Selection**
     - Select your Tesla energy site from the dropdown
     - Select Amber site (if you have multiple)
     - Enable automatic TOU schedule syncing (recommended)

4. **Verify Setup**
   - Check that new sensors appear:
     - `sensor.current_electricity_price`
     - `sensor.solar_power`
     - `sensor.grid_power`
     - `sensor.battery_power`
     - `sensor.home_load`
     - `sensor.battery_level`
   - Check that the switch appears:
     - `switch.auto_sync_tou_schedule`

### Automatic TOU Syncing

**The integration automatically syncs your TOU schedule every 5 minutes** (aligned with Amber Electric's forecast updates) when the auto-sync switch is enabled.

**How it works:**
1. Enable the `switch.auto_sync_tou_schedule` switch (enabled by default during setup)
2. The integration runs a background timer that checks every 5 minutes
3. If auto-sync is enabled, it automatically:
   - Fetches the latest Amber pricing forecast
   - Converts it to Tesla TOU format
   - Sends it to your Powerwall via Teslemetry API
4. If auto-sync is disabled, the timer skips syncing

**No automation required!** Just leave the switch on and the integration handles everything automatically, just like the Docker version.

You can disable automatic syncing by turning off the switch, and re-enable it anytime.

### Available Services (Advanced)

```yaml
# Manually sync TOU schedule
service: tesla_amber_sync.sync_tou_schedule

# Refresh data from Amber and Teslemetry
service: tesla_amber_sync.sync_now
```

### Example Automations (Optional)

These are optional automations for advanced users. **Auto-sync is automatic and doesn't require any automations.**

**Force immediate sync on price spike:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Force TOU Sync on Price Spike"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.current_electricity_price
    condition:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.current_electricity_price
        above: 0.30
    action:
      - service: tesla_amber_sync.sync_tou_schedule
```

**Disable auto-sync during off-peak hours:**
```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Disable Auto-Sync at Night"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "23:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.tesla_amber_sync_auto_sync

  - alias: "Enable Auto-Sync in Morning"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "06:00:00"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: switch.tesla_amber_sync_auto_sync
```

### Troubleshooting

- **No sensors appearing**: Check that the integration is enabled in Settings → Devices & Services
- **Invalid API token**: Verify tokens at Amber and Teslemetry websites
- **No Tesla sites found**: Ensure your Tesla account is linked in Teslemetry
- **TOU sync failing**: Check Home Assistant logs for detailed error messages

  -p 5001:5001 \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data \
  -e SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  bolagnaise/tesla-sync:latest

# Note: Encryption key is auto-generated and saved to ./data/.fernet_key
# Tesla OAuth credentials can be configured via the Environment Settings page in the web UI
```

**Environment Variables:**

```bash
# Required
SECRET_KEY=your-random-secret-key-here

# Optional - Auto-generated if not provided
# FERNET_ENCRYPTION_KEY=your-custom-key-here
```

**Note on Configuration:**
- **Encryption Key:** Automatically generated and saved to `./data/.fernet_key` on first run. Only set `FERNET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` if you want to use a specific key (e.g., migrating from another instance).
- **Important:** Back up `./data/.fernet_key` - without it, you cannot decrypt stored credentials

**Docker Hub Image Details:**
- **Repository:** `bolagnaise/tesla-sync`
- **Multi-Architecture:** Supports `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`
- **Automated Builds:** Every push to main branch
- **Production Server:** Gunicorn with 4 workers

### Method 2: Build from Source

For development or customization:

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bolagnaise/tesla-sync.git
cd tesla-sync
```

2. **Create `.env` file**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. **Edit `.env` with your credentials** (see environment variables above)
   - Encryption key will be auto-generated on first run

4. **Create data directory**
```bash
mkdir -p ./data
```

5. **Start with Docker Compose**
```bash
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d
```

6. **Access the dashboard**
```
http://localhost:5001
```

### Method 3: Python Virtual Environment (Advanced)

For local development without Docker:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your credentials

# Initialize database
flask db upgrade

# Run application
flask run
```

Navigate to http://localhost:5001

## Docker Management

### View Logs
```bash
# Docker Compose (from source)
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml logs -f

# Docker Compose (pre-built, if using docker-compose.hub.yml)
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml logs -f

# Docker run
docker logs -f tesla-sync
```

### Update to Latest Version

**Pre-built Image:**
```bash
docker pull bolagnaise/tesla-sync:latest
docker restart tesla-sync

# Or with docker-compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml pull
docker-compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

**Built from Source:**
```bash
cd tesla-sync
git pull
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml down
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d --build
```

**Local Development (Python venv):**
```bash
cd tesla-sync
git pull
source venv/bin/activate
flask db upgrade  # Apply any database migrations
# Restart flask
```

> **Note:** Database migrations are automatically applied when using Docker. For local development, you must run `flask db upgrade` after pulling updates to ensure your database schema is current.

### Data Persistence

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: Your database is stored in the `./data` directory. **Create this directory before first run** to prevent data loss during upgrades:

```bash
mkdir -p ./data
```

**Your data:**
- Database: `./data/app.db` (user accounts, API credentials, settings)
- This directory is mounted as a Docker volume for persistence
- **If `./data` doesn't exist, a fresh database is created on each restart**

**Quick backup:**
```bash
# Backup database
cp ./data/app.db ./data/app.db.backup-$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Restore database
cp ./data/app.db.backup-YYYYMMDD ./data/app.db
docker restart tesla-sync
```
