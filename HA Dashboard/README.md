# Home Assistant Dashboard for PowerSync

A pre-built Lovelace dashboard for visualizing your Tesla Powerwall and Amber Electric data.

## Preview

The dashboard includes:
- **Price Gauges** - Compact gauges for import price, feed-in price, and battery level
- **Battery Control** - Force charge, force discharge, and restore normal buttons with duration selectors
- **Power Flow Card** - Real-time energy flow visualization
- **Price Charts** - Amber prices and TOU schedule sent to Tesla
- **Battery Health** - Radial chart showing overall and individual battery health (up to 4 batteries)
- **Energy Charts** - Solar, Battery, Grid, and Home load graphs
- **Solar Curtailment Status** - Shows when export is blocked due to negative prices

## Requirements

### Required HACS Integrations

Install these from HACS (Frontend) before setting up the dashboard:

1. **[mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom)** - For the force discharge control chips
2. **[card-mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/lovelace-card-mod)** - For compact gauge styling
3. **[power-flow-card-plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus)** - For the real-time energy flow visualization
4. **[apexcharts-card](https://github.com/RomRider/apexcharts-card)** - For all the price and energy charts

### Required Helper Entities

The battery control buttons require two `input_select` helpers for duration selection:

**Helper 1: Force Discharge Duration**
1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Helpers**
2. Click **+ Create Helper → Dropdown**
3. Configure:
   - Name: `Force Discharge Duration`
   - Options: `15`, `30`, `45`, `60`, `90`, `120`
4. Click **Create**

**Helper 2: Force Charge Duration**
1. Click **+ Create Helper → Dropdown** again
2. Configure:
   - Name: `Force Charge Duration`
   - Options: `15`, `30`, `45`, `60`, `90`, `120`
3. Click **Create**

The entity IDs are automatically derived from the names (`input_select.force_discharge_duration` and `input_select.force_charge_duration`).

## Installation

### Method 1: Import as New Dashboard

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Settings → Dashboards**
2. Click **+ Add Dashboard**
3. Choose **New dashboard from scratch**
4. Give it a name (e.g., "PowerSync")
5. Click **Create**
6. Open the new dashboard and click the three dots menu → **Edit Dashboard**
7. Click the three dots menu again → **Raw configuration editor**
8. Delete any existing content and paste the entire contents of `tesla_sync_dashboard.yaml`
9. Click **Save**

### Method 2: Add as a View to Existing Dashboard

1. Open your existing dashboard
2. Click the three dots menu → **Edit Dashboard**
3. Click the three dots menu → **Raw configuration editor**
4. Add the view from `tesla_sync_dashboard.yaml` to your existing views array
5. Click **Save**

## Customization

### Entity Names

The dashboard uses these default entity names. If your entities have different names, use find/replace:

| Default Entity | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| `sensor.amber_general_price` | Amber import price |
| `sensor.amber_feed_in_price` | Amber feed-in price |
| `sensor.battery_level` | Powerwall battery percentage |
| `sensor.battery_power` | Powerwall charge/discharge power |
| `sensor.solar_power` | Solar generation power |
| `sensor.grid_power` | Grid import/export power |
| `sensor.home_load` | Home consumption power |
| `sensor.tariff_schedule` | TOU schedule sensor |
| `sensor.solar_curtailment` | Curtailment status sensor |
| `sensor.battery_health` | Battery health from mobile app TEDAPI scan |

### Chart Heights

The energy charts (Solar, Battery, Grid, Home) use `height: 150` by default. Adjust this value in each chart's `apex_config.chart.height` to make them larger or smaller.

### Price Range

The price gauges are configured for typical Australian electricity prices:
- Import: 0-60 ¢/kWh
- Feed-in: -10 to 30 ¢/kWh

Adjust the `min` and `max` values if your prices differ.

## Amber Price Models

PowerSync supports three different Amber pricing models for TOU schedule generation. Configure this in the PowerSync integration options.

### Predicted (Default)

Uses Amber's **forecast price** - their best estimate of what the price will be at each interval.

- **Best for:** Most users, balanced approach
- **Behavior:** Schedules battery based on expected prices
- **Risk level:** Medium - prices may end up higher or lower than predicted

### High (Conservative)

Uses Amber's **high estimate** - the upper bound of their price confidence interval.

- **Best for:** Risk-averse users who want to avoid unexpected high prices
- **Behavior:** Assumes prices will be at the higher end, leading to more conservative battery usage
- **Risk level:** Low - you're prepared for worst-case pricing
- **Trade-off:** May charge battery when actual prices end up being low

### Low (Aggressive)

Uses Amber's **low estimate** - the lower bound of their price confidence interval.

- **Best for:** Users comfortable with price volatility who want to maximize savings
- **Behavior:** Assumes prices will be at the lower end, leading to more aggressive battery usage
- **Risk level:** High - actual prices may be significantly higher than planned
- **Trade-off:** Better savings when predictions are accurate, but exposed to price spikes

### Which Model Should I Use?

| Scenario | Recommended Model |
|----------|-------------------|
| New to Amber/PowerSync | **Predicted** - see how it performs first |
| Want to minimize bill surprises | **High** - conservative approach |
| Comfortable with volatility | **Low** - maximize potential savings |
| High solar generation | **Predicted** or **Low** - excess solar provides buffer |
| Limited battery capacity | **High** - ensure battery is charged before peaks |

### Changing the Price Model

1. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → PowerSync**
2. Click **Configure**
3. Select your preferred **Price Model** (Predicted, High, or Low)
4. Click **Submit**

The new model takes effect on the next price sync (typically within 5 minutes).

## Troubleshooting

### Cards showing "Custom element doesn't exist"

This means a required HACS card isn't installed. Install the missing integration from HACS:
- `custom:mushroom-chips-card` → Install mushroom
- `custom:apexcharts-card` → Install apexcharts-card
- `custom:power-flow-card-plus` → Install power-flow-card-plus

### Gauges or curtailment card not styled correctly

Install the **card-mod** HACS integration for full styling support.

### Battery control buttons not working

Ensure you've created both helper entities (see Requirements above):
- `input_select.force_discharge_duration`
- `input_select.force_charge_duration`

### Charts showing no data

- Ensure the PowerSync integration is properly configured
- Check that entity names match your actual entities (see below)
- Wait for the integration to collect some data (may take 5-10 minutes)
- Trigger a sync via the "Sync Now" service or wait for automatic sync

### Finding Your Entity IDs

The dashboard uses generic entity names like `sensor.tariff_schedule`. Your actual entity IDs may differ based on your Home Assistant configuration.

To find your actual entity IDs:
1. Go to **Developer Tools → States**
2. Search for "tesla" or "tariff" to find your entities
3. Look in the HA logs for: `Tariff schedule sensor registered with entity_id: sensor.xxx`
4. Update the dashboard YAML with your actual entity IDs

Common entity ID patterns:
- `sensor.tariff_schedule` (if no device prefix)
- `sensor.tesla_sync_tariff_schedule` (with integration prefix)
- `sensor.<site_name>_tariff_schedule` (with site name prefix)

### TOU Schedule Chart Not Updating

If the TOU Schedule chart shows old data or no data:
1. Check HA logs for "Tariff schedule stored" messages to verify sync happened
2. Verify the entity_id in the dashboard matches your actual sensor
3. Reload the dashboard page (not just refresh)
4. Check that `apexcharts-card` is installed from HACS
